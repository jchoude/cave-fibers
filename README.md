cave-fibers
===========

A project to bring Fiber tractography visualization and interaction to the University of Sherbrooke's CAVE-like environment.

The project currently supports showing streamlines representing White Matter fibers, as well as a mesh for representing
a surface (for example, a tumor). The user can also add Selection Boxes and move them using the wand to select only
a subset of the shown streamlines.
